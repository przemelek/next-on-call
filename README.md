When is my next on-call? When it will end? ;-)
====================
Very simple app, which reads calendar win WebCal format (only with simple DSTART and DEND), builds its local "copy" of this calendar and shows time to next event, and in case event is in progress shows how long to end of event.
For me, I'm using it with my private feed generated by PagerDuty to see when will by my next on-call shift, and during shift how long it will take ;-)

Nothing fancy, written in rudimentary JavaScript.

Still do a trick ;-)
